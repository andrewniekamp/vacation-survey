### Description
Vacation Survey collects various answers from the user, and uses JavaScript to determine which (from a short list of destinations) is likely to be a meaningful recommendation to the user.

There are fade effects to show and hide various parts of the page upon form submission, and the survey can be revisited and answers revised and resubmitted without needing to actually reload the page.
